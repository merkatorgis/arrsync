Configures the Server or the Client side of a secure channel for file transfer.
Start with the Server side.

Usage:
• Server: sudo $exec [-s] [-u USER] [-h HOST] [-r READ] [-w WRITE]
  -s is for Server
  -u sets the name of the user as which clients will connect. A new user is
     created if it doesn't exist.
  -h sets the host name of this server to which the clients will connect.
  -r sets the list of client IP addresses that are allowed to read files from
     this server, e.g. 127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2
  -w sets the list of client IP addresses that are allowed to write files to
     this server, e.g. 127.0.0.3,127.0.0.4
• Client: $exec [-c] [-u USER] [-h HOST] [-p PORT]
  -c is for Client
  -u sets the name of the user as which to connect.
  -h sets the host name of the server to connect to.
  -p sets the port number where the SSH is listening on the server.
• Help: $exec [-H]
All options are optional; if not present, input will be requested interactively,
except for -p, for which the default value is 22.

Once both Server and Client are configured, the Client can download files from
and/or upload files to the server.
• To download all files to the current directory (.):
  rsync -avz HOST-USER-read: .
• To upload all files from the current directory (.):
  rsync -avz . HOST-USER-write:
